# Projective-Transformation
A C++ program that does a projective tranform from the chosen quadrirateral of an ASCII-art image to a rectangle.

How to read input:
- \<image width> \<image height>
- \<x, y coordinates of the source quadrilateral that we project. Any order.>
- \<width and height of the rectangle we project on>
- \<image, written in ASCII art>

Output must be a projected image of size that correnponds to the chosen rectangle.

The problem was written for the Apostera course. The program does the transformation in the projective space, using no additional libraries.
